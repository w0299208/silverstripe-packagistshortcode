Packagist Short Code
=================
Add a short code for adding a Packagist installs button with a count to a HTMLText field.

## Maintainer Contact
* Ed Chipman ([UndefinedOffset](https://github.com/UndefinedOffset))

## Requirements
* SilverStripe CMS 4.x


## Installation
* Download the module from here https://github.com/webbuilders-group/silverstripe-packagistshortcode/archive/master.zip
* Extract the downloaded archive into your site root so that the destination folder is called githubshortcode, opening the extracted folder should contain _config.php in the root along with other files/folders
* Run dev/build?flush=all to regenerate the manifest


## Usage
Usage is pretty straight forward to add a packagist downloads button you simply add the following:
```
[packagist package="package owner/package name"]
```

Optionally you may add mode="monthly" or button="daily" (defaults to total) to show the download count for the given period.
```
[packagist package="package owner/package name" mode="monthly"]

```

In 3.1 the short codes above will work as included however the updated syntax for the short code would be (of course layout and button are not required):
```
[packagist,package="package owner/package name",mode="monthly"]
```


#### Configuration Options
There are a few configuration options available to you:

```yml
